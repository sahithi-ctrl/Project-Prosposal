What we intend to create

Millions all around the world are passively investing in crypto currency without keeping track of their investments. While investing in crypto is a good way to diversity oneâ€™s portfolio, it should be done with diligence and the investment portfolio needs to be catalogued. We aim to create a crypto portfolio visualizing and tracker web app where potential investors could enter their transactions and learn about their growth prospect based, on market sentiment and social media interaction.


Our Tech Stack

FrontEnd - React JS with Chakra UI for App side code

BackEnd - Python Flask micro framework for the server side code

Database/Data Storage - PostGresql which is spun up using docker via docker compose

APIs - We will be using Coingecko to retrieve like crpyto currency prices. And for Portfolio analysis we will be using the tweepy API, and possibly reddit API


We added a Lucid Chart to the github directory (title - Crypto-Visualization-and-Tracking-App-Basic-Outline.pdf
) outlining how we want our application to look when a user opens it.
